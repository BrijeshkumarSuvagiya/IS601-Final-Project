**Testing Observations:**
- Testing Protocol
# A/B Testing:

Users interacted with both versions, recording metrics such as task completion time, errors, and satisfaction. A/B testing helped quantify the impact of design changes on user interaction and satisfaction.

# Think Out Loud:

Participants verbalized thoughts and feelings while navigating both versions. Valuable qualitative data was collected regarding user preferences and perceptions of the design changes.

# 5-Second Protocol:

Users were briefly exposed to each version for 5 seconds. Initial impressions and key elements noticed within this short timeframe were recorded.

## Testing Sessions

### Session 1 (Date: 11/27/2023):

Users interacted with Version 1. A/B testing identified areas for improvement, with users expressing a desire for a more visually appealing hero section. Version 2 implemented changes based on feedback, introducing a more vibrant and user-friendly hero section. Users interacted with the updated Version 2. A/B testing results showed improvements in user satisfaction and task completion. Think Out Loud sessions indicated positive feedback on the visual enhancements.

## Conclusion

The iterative design process significantly improved user satisfaction and engagement. Transitioning from Version 1 to Version 2 addressed user preferences, demonstrating the effectiveness of iterative testing.
